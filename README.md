Steps to run Python Virtual Environment on Windows and get all the requirements installed inside it and send it to github:
1. Go to your IDE (In my case, VS code) terminal and open your project directory.
2. Run "python -m venv venv" in the terminal to create a new virtual environemnt. After this, you should see a new folder called "venv" created inside your project directory
3. After this point, you want to activate the virtual environment. You need to write "venv\Scripts\activate" on the terminal.
